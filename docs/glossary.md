**CRUD** - CRUD refers to Create, Read, Update, Delete which are four basic functions used in persistent storage.

**Endpoint** - An Endpoint is the point of interaction between a service and client application the endpoint is URL where your service can be accessed by a client application.

**GET** - A method used in communication between a HTTP client and a server. The GET method is used to request certain data from the server. GET requests should never be used when handling sensitive data and cannot modify request data.

**HTTP** - HTTP is an acronym for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol". The HTTP is used to transfer data over the web and defines services and commands used to communicating webside data.

**JSON** - JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" and is the format used for storing and transporting data between a server and web page. The data is stored in name/value pairs inside curly braces to hol objects and square brackets to store arrays.

**POST** - Similar to a the GET method, POST requests can however, create and update data. A POST request is never cached, does not remain in the history of a browser, and has no data length restrictions.

**Params (Parameter)** - A Parameter is a special variable or argument that is passed into a function. A parameter refers to a piece of data provided as input to the function.

**PUT** - A PUT request inputs a resource at a specific URI and only at that URI. If an existing resoure is at that URI, the PUT request will replace it. Therefore the PUT method enables the state of the resource to be created or replaced with the defined state enclosed in the new PUT payload.

**Request** - Requests are made between web browsers and web servers when information is required from the requestor.

**Response** - Responses are answers to requests that are made in the exchange patterns between web browsers and web servers

**Status** - A status describes an outcome of either success or fail in the final state of the request/response message exchange pattern. Status responses are grouped in the following classes:

* 100 - Informational Responses

* 300 - Redirected Responses
* 400 - Client Error Responses
* 500 - Server Error Responses

**URI** - The URI or "Uniform Resource Identifier" is a collection of characters that identifies a specific resource. In order to ensure uniformity, URI's adhere to a predefined set of syntax rules.
